 I want to be a **full-stack web developer**. <br>
 Currently , I'm learning **front-end** web development. <br>
 Later, when I'd be ready and will be **true master** of **front-end** , I'll focus on **Backend** web development <br>
 
Till then , stay with me <br>

o' wait ! For now , I know ` HTML ` , `CSS` and `Bootstrap`. <br>
Currently , I'm learning ` JavaScript`.<br>
And trying to focus which would be better for me before I learn `Angular`, is it `React` or `Vue` ? <br>
What do you think ?
Tell anywhere else below :point_down: <br><br>
